# Vision2CADQuery: Image-to-Code Generation for CAD

This repository provides two implementations of a deep learning pipeline that translates **images of 3D CAD models** into **CADQuery code** using a combination of **ResNet50** for image encoding and **GPT-2** for code generation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

- `mecAgentBaseline.ipynb/` â€” First version of the pipeline with basic preprocessing and fixed dataset handling
- `mecAgentEnhanced.ipynb/` â€” Improved version with better tokenization, data augmentation, and modularity


---

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

> Convert rendered CAD model images into corresponding CADQuery code using a multimodal transformer pipeline.
